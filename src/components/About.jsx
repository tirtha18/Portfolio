            I am a pre final year student of Electrical Engineering (specialization in Power Engineering) at Jadavpur University, pursuing a B.Tech degree. As an aspiring full-stack developer, my journey in the world of web development is marked by an unyielding curiosity and an unwavering commitment to mastering the craft. I am deeply enthusiastic about creating web applications that not only look visually appealing but also deliver exceptional user experiences. My foray into this exciting field started with the thrill of coding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring web pages to life. As I progressed, I began to explore the intricacies of server-side development, immersing myself in languages like Python, Node.js, and Java. This dual skill set empowers me to not only design engaging front-end interfaces but also build resilient, efficient back-end systems that breathe life into these interfaces. I'm driven to stay on the cutting edge of technology, and I thrive on the collaborative process, transforming ideas into tangible web solutions alongside diverse teams.
